#Introduction
	* New age of encryption- cloud, compliance, and covert affairs.
	* Plenty of options, but little guidance.
	* Map requirements to design, and the answer will emerge.
		
#Understanding encryption systems
		* Three components- data, key, engine
		* Systems are built based on the location of those components
		* The great encryption tradeoff- the higher you encrypt, the more complex, but the better the protection.
		* The three laws of encryption
		* Tokenization and data masking
	
#Encryption Layers 		* Application
